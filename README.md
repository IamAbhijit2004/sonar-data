# 🪨 Rock vs Mine Prediction using Machine Learning

This project applies machine learning to classify sonar signal data as either rocks or mines. It uses supervised learning techniques to train a model on labeled data and predict outcomes based on sonar features.

## 📌 Features

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Supervised model training (e.g., Logistic Regression)
- Model evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix
- Real-time prediction using custom input

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook
- **Libraries**:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - scikit-learn

## 📁 Files

- `Rock_vs_Mine_Prediction.ipynb`: The main notebook containing code, analysis, and model
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies to install
